# Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm Assignment

This project is a Windows Forms application that demonstrates the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm in C#.

## How It Works
- The user can configure ABC parameters and run the algorithm on sample optimization problems.
- The application visualizes the bee colony and the optimization process.

## How to Run
1. Open the `odev5_abc.csproj` or the solution file in Visual Studio.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Use the interface to set parameters and start the ABC algorithm.

> Note: This project targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 and uses Windows Forms.
