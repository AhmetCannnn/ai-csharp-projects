# 8-Puzzle Solver (A* Algorithm)

This project is a console application that solves the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm in C#.

## How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter the initial state of the puzzle (numbers 0-8, where 0 represents the empty space).
- The program uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest solution path to the goal state:
  
  `1 2 3`
  `4 5 6`
  `7 8 0`
- The solution steps and the number of moves are displayed in the console.

## How to Run
1. Open the `8_tas_bulmacasi.sln` file with Visual Studio.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Enter the puzzle state as prompted in the console.
