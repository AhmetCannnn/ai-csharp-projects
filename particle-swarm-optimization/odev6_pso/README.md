# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Assignment

This project is a Windows Forms application that demonstrates the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in C#.

## How It Works
- The user can configure PSO parameters and run the algorithm on sample optimization problems.
- The application visualizes the swarm and the optimization process.

## How to Run
1. Open the `odev6_pso.csproj` or the solution file in Visual Studio.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Use the interface to set parameters and start the PSO algorithm.
