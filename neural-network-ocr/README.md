# Neural Network OCR Assignment

This project is a Windows Forms application that demonstrates a simple neural network (MLP) for optical character recognition (OCR) in C#.

## How It Works
- The user can train a neural network with sample data and test it on handwritten digits or characters.
- The application visualizes the training process and recognition results.

## How to Run
1. Open the `ocr.csproj` file with Visual Studio.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Use the interface to train the neural network and test OCR.

> Note: This project targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 and uses Windows Forms.
