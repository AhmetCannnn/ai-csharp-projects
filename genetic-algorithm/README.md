# Genetic Algorithm Assignment

This project is a Windows Forms application that demonstrates the use of a genetic algorithm to solve optimization problems.

## How It Works
- The user can configure genetic algorithm parameters and run the algorithm on test problems.
- The application visualizes the population and the evolution process.

## How to Run
1. Open the `odev2_genetik_algoritma.sln` file with Visual Studio.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Use the interface to set parameters and start the genetic algorithm.

> Note: This project targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 and uses Windows Forms.
